"""database.models
Declarative exports for core SQLModel entities used by QA Intelligence.

Cleaning goals:
- Remove large commented blocks that created noise in diffs.
- Export only models that are actually safe to import at app start.
- Keep optional OAuth models behind a bestâ€‘effort import so missing tables
  or partial environments don't break startup.
- Provide a minimal MODEL_REGISTRY used by migration/introspection utilities.
