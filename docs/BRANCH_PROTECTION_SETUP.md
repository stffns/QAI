# Branch Protection Setup - QAI Project

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Overview
Branch protection rules have been successfully configured for the `develop` branch using GitHub CLI to prevent direct pushes and enforce proper Git workflow through Pull Requests.

### Configuration Applied

#### Protection Rules Enabled:
- **Required Pull Request Reviews**: Enabled with 1 required approving review
- **Dismiss Stale Reviews**: Enabled (reviews dismissed when new commits are pushed)
- **Require Linear History**: Enabled (prevents merge commits, enforces rebase/squash)
- **Block Force Pushes**: Enabled (prevents `git push --force`)
- **Block Deletions**: Enabled (prevents branch deletion)
- **Enforce Rules for Administrators**: ✅ **ENABLED** (critical for preventing bypasses)

#### Commands Used:
```bash
# 1. Create comprehensive protection rules
gh api --method PUT repos/stffns/QAI/branches/develop/protection --input temp/branch-protection.json

# 2. Enable admin enforcement (critical step)
gh api --method POST repos/stffns/QAI/branches/develop/protection/enforce_admins
```

### Testing Results

#### Test 1: Without Admin Enforcement
- **Result**: ❌ Push succeeded with "Bypassed rule violations" message
- **Issue**: Admin users could bypass protection rules

#### Test 2: With Admin Enforcement  
- **Result**: ✅ Push blocked with proper error message
- **Message**: `"Changes must be made through a pull request"`
- **Error Code**: `GH006: Protected branch update failed`

### Current Branch Status

#### Develop Branch State:
- **Local**: Clean state at commit `31b494e` (correct)
- **Remote**: Contains 2 test commits that need cleanup via PR
- **Protection**: Fully active and enforced for all users including admins

#### Required Workflow:
All changes to `develop` must now go through:
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push feature branch
4. Create Pull Request
5. Get approval from another team member
6. Merge via PR (squash/rebase preferred)

### Key Learnings

1. **Admin Enforcement is Critical**: Without `enforce_admins: true`, administrators can bypass all protection rules
2. **GitHub CLI is Effective**: Provides precise control over branch protection settings
3. **Immediate Effect**: Protection rules are applied instantly once configured
4. **Force Push Blocked**: Even force pushes are blocked, ensuring history integrity

### Cleanup Required

The remote `develop` branch currently has 2 test commits:
- `4f79538` - "test: verify branch protection rules"  
- `14832c9` - "test: verify admin enforcement works"

These commits demonstrate the protection is working but should be removed through a proper PR process.

### Files Created During Setup
- `temp/branch-protection.json` - Protection rules configuration (can be deleted)
- `test-protection.md` - Test file (can be deleted) 
- `test-protection-2.md` - Second test file (can be deleted)

### GitHub CLI Configuration Used
```json
{
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true,
    "require_code_owner_reviews": false,
    "require_last_push_approval": false,
    "required_approving_review_count": 1
  },
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": []
  },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_linear_history": true,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check current protection status
gh api repos/stffns/QAI/branches/develop/protection

# Verify admin enforcement is enabled
gh api repos/stffns/QAI/branches/develop/protection/enforce_admins
```
